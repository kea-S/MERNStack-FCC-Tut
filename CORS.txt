CORS is an important policy in webdDev. Cors is a security measure that 
restricts a webpage to make requests to a different domain. Stands for 
"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing".

What happens?
When a browser wants to access a different domain, it sends a request to that
domain's target server. The server then decides if the request is permitted or
not. It checks: 1. Origins, 2. Methods, 3. Headers.
